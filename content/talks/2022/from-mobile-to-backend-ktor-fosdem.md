abstract: As mobile develpers, we often see the SDK development or multiplatform development as magical that "does things". But what if I tell you that you can build KMM/KMP SDK's/App's even if you're from mobile developer background. With this talk, I want to show how it's possible to bring your mobile knowledge to build SDK's/App's with Kotlin. I will show you how to structure the project, setup required dependencies, connect to a database and test everything to hae working SDK's to be deployed.
